  Why are independent bookstores blossoming after the apparent demise of civil
  society in Hong Kong? Through interviews and ethnography, we argue that
  independent bookstores in Hong Kong fulfill a vital role in the continuation
  of a semblance of civil society amidst a crackdown in society. Activism has
  turned to a more quotidian form in which people buy books or organise
  workshops to support each other. We argue that independent bookstores aligned
  with Hong Kong’s democracy movement foster a sense of temporary community and
  solidarity through their space, allowing visitors to work out lingering
  emotions from prior protests, and , fostering a sense of communion through
  books and cultural references to Hong Kong identity and culture. They serve as
  places where the ‘spirit of the [2019 social] movement’ can still be felt in a
  city where regular political expressions have become almost impossible.
